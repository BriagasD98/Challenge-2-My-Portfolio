# Challenge-2-My-Portfolio

## Introduction
This is my portfolio for coding/web-development. The purpose of this project
is to create a starter portfolio which i can build upon with related work to come.
Having a portfolio with previous work and experience is crucial for landing a job in
web-development, as it displays one's talents and experience.

## My Assignment
My assignment was to create functional portfolio that works in the real world.
It needed to have features such as links, a functional navigation bar, contact-info, examples
of previous work as well as links to them, a bio and more.
